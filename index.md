## Welcome to VDR-Projects

### What is this?

This page is meant to provide an overview about where which VDR plugin is currently maintained or if it is maintained at all. Additionally the "vdr-projects" GitHub organization can provide repositories for projects that are related to VDR.

### How does "Community maintenance" work?

As an alternative to scattered patches all over the internet, once a project is obviously no longer maintained (no feedback from developer and no new versions for at least 6 months or longer), then this project can be mirrored to a repository below the "vdr-projects" organization.

Having a repository in context of the "vdr-projects" organization, where still someone can react to requests, allows to keep the plugin at least working with newer VDR versions based on community contributions. It provides an "active target" to point Pull-Requests to without someone needing to take responsibility for the whole project.

If a developer officially announces that he stops maintaining his project, then a repository below "vdr-projects" may be created earlier if noone decides to continue developing it somewhere else.


### What if I want to take over a currently unmaintained project?

If someone wants to actively maintain a currently unmaintained project, then he can apply for commit permissions to the repository hosted in the "vdr-projects" organization at any time.

Keep in mind that this only works for a project in status "Community maintained". For actively maintained projects, only the current maintainer can add new contributors!

If you don't want to continue maintaining a project in its current repository (for example move it to your GitHub profile or to a different hosting platform), then it would be nice if you at least let us know, so the table at the start of this page can be updated.

### Can I request a new repository in context of the vdr-projects organization?

Yes, you can. Just open an issue [here](https://github.com/vdr-projects/vdr-projects.github.io/issues).

### What is the advantage of having my plugin hosted in context of the organization?

If the plugin ever gets unmaintained again, then the actual project homepage and all links would be still the same if someone else takes over.

Worst case the vdr-projects organization could even give ownership to someone else if a project is unmaintained for a long period of time and the current maintainer does not respond for whatever reason.

### I'd like to communicate with you? How can I do that?
That's easy. If you want to take over a plugin have someone removed from your plugin or for everything else, just open an issue [here](https://github.com/vdr-projects/vdr-projects.github.io/issues).

### I am a developer and want to join you
That's nice to hear. Open an issue [here](https://github.com/vdr-projects/vdr-projects.github.io/issues). Tell us in one or two sentences who you are and what you want to achieve. If we are satisfied, we'll give you organization member status, which gives you the ability to add new repositories to the organization.
